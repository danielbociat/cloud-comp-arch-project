For the clused to be deleted at the end, uncomment last two lines from the script.

To separately delete the cluser run `python3 kill.py n`, where n is the value of the part of the project, i.e. '2a' when doing work for part2a of the project or '3' for part3

# Part 2a

To run the script with all the measurements run `python3 script2a.py`

# Part 2b

To run the script with all the measurements run `python3 script2b.py`

# Part 3 (WIP)

To run the script with all the measurements run `python3 script3.py`
